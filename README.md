# Javascript-Copy-of-olcPixelGameEngine

I tried making a javascript game engine that operates similarly to the olcPixelGameEngine created by Javidx9 at 
https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine.git

Basic Features Include:
* A game loop function.
* Handling keyboard input(key is pressed/held/or released)
* Render functions.
  
Requires 3 Files(game.html, game.js, GameEngine.js)

Example using github-pages: https://dashcampbell.github.io/Javascript-Copy-of-olcPixelGameEngine
* More implementations included in folders.
