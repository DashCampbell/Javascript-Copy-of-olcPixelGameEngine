# Javascript-Copy-of-olcPixelGameEngine

I tried making a javascript game engine that operates similarly to the by the OneLoneCoder olcPixelGameEngine.cpp at https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine.git

Basic Features Include:
  -A game loop function.
  -Handling keyboard input(key is pressed/held/or released)
  -Render functions.
  
 Example implementaions included in folders.
